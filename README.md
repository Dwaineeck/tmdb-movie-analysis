Using the TMDB movies dataset from Kaggle, you can perform a variety of data science activities that are useful for research and analysis. Below are several task ideas categorized into different data science activities:

**Data Cleaning and Preparation**
Handling Missing Values:

Identify and fill or remove missing values in columns such as budget, revenue, runtime, etc.
Convert appropriate columns to numeric types if they are not already (e.g., budget, revenue, runtime).
**Removing Duplicates:**

Identify duplicate rows based on movie titles or other key attributes and remove them to avoid redundant data.
**Data Type Conversion:**

Convert date columns to datetime format.
Convert categorical columns to category type for efficient memory usage.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**Descriptive Statistics:**

Generate summary statistics for numeric columns like budget, revenue, runtime, etc.
Analyze the distribution of movie genres, release years, and production companies.
**Visualization:**

Create histograms and box plots for numeric columns to understand their distribution and identify outliers.
Generate bar charts to show the count of movies by genre, year, and production company.
**Correlation Analysis:**

Calculate and visualize the correlation matrix for numeric columns to understand relationships between them.
**Feature Engineering**
Extracting Features from Text:

Use NLP techniques to extract keywords from movie overviews and taglines.
Generate sentiment scores for movie overviews.
**Creating New Features:**

Calculate the profit column as the difference between revenue and budget.
